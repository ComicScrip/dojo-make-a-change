			Ever wondered how do automatic checkouts 
			in supermarkets deal with change making ?
		</p>


		<p>
			In order for the self-checkouts to be efficient, 
			they need to give back money to 
			the customer in a way that minimizes the 
			total number of coins/bills it returns. 	
		</p>

		<p>To simplify the problem we'll first asume that :</p>	
		<ul>
				<li>
						The machine only deals with 
						coins which will have a value of 2, 5 or 10.
				</li>
				<li>
						The amout of money the machine 
			      has to return in the form of coins is always 
						a positive integer.
				</li>
				<li>
						Each coin value is available in unlimited quantities.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The goal of this exercise is to develop an algorithm 
			whose purpose is to choose which coins the machine should return to the customer.
			<br/>
			Example : 
			<br/>
			Imagine that the cash machine has to return $29 in coins.
			Sure we could return :
		</p>
		<ul>
				<li>two coins of 2</li>
				<li>three coin of 5</li>
				<li>one coin of 10</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			But it's not optimal, we're using 6 coins in total, when we could have used
			5, by returning money like this : 
		</p>
		<ul>
				<li>two coins of 2</li>
				<li>one coin of 5</li>
				<li>two coin of 10</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Your algorithm should always output the optimal solution
			in the form of an object that maps coin values to the amount of coin of a given value to return.
			For the previous example that would be {"2": 2, "5": 1, "10": 2}.
			If there's no solution for the problem with the given contraints, the function should return null.
